# The bottom 3 entries were generated by YAST/openSUSE.  The first entry (0)
# was hand-input after the first automated phase of X/LAPP completed.  Then,
# we were able to boot to that system.
#
# Inside that system (entry 0) we were able to log in as the 'blfs' user
# and compile the remaining packages (including Xen, its dependencies, and
# several important conveniences).
# 
# The second entry (1) was hand-input after the post-boot automated phase of
# X/LAPP completed.  Xen was successfully built at this point.  The hypervisor
# kernel was hand-installed into /mnt/boot (not /boot, since this is the target
# system, not the openSUSE LFS-host system--mounted at /mnt), and this new
# boot entry was added.
#
# At this point, we were able to reboot the system into the Xen hypervisor,
# and our kernel booted successfully as Xen priviledged domain 0.
