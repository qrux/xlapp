What is X/LAPP?
===============

X/LAPP is take on "LAPP".  It stands for "Xen/LFS Apache Postgres PHP".


I thought the 'L' in "LAPP" stood for Linux.  What's this 'LFS'?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Well, LFS itself stands for "Linux From Scratch".  It's a project
intended to teach people how Linux works, and is a book intended to
guide a user through the entire process of compiling Linux from
source.  X/LAPP, then, is a way to compile the entire OS, plus a web
stack (composed of...duh...Apache, Postgres, and PHP), entirely
from source code.
